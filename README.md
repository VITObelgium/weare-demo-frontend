# Demo Weare Fe

This is the demo front end project for implementations on the We Are Platform. The front end is written in Angular and is responsible for

- calling authentication to the We Are Authentication endpoint
- writing data to the user's pod
- reading data from the user's pod
- initiating an access request to the data created in the user's pod by calling the We Are Access request endpoint.

## Running the application

Run `npm install` to install all dependencies for the project.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
